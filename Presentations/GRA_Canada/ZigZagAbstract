Title: Zigzag structure for maps and complexes

Abstract: A zigzag in a planar graph is a circuit of edges,
such that any two, but no three, consecutive edges belong
to the same face.

A railroad in a planar graph is a circuit of hexagonal faces,
such that any hexagon is adjacent to its neighbors on opposite
edges. A graph without a railroad is called tight.

We consider those notions for 3-valent plane graphs, whose
faces have gonality q ( <6) or 6. 

Then, we explain how zigzags are part of Lins trialities on
surfaces and how they can be defined on n-dimensional complexes.
