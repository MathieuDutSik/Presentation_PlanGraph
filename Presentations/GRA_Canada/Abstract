Title: zigzags and central circuits for 3- or 4-valent plane graphs
Abstract: A central circuit in a 4-valent plane graph is a circuit
of edges, such that no two consecutive edges belong to the same face.
A zigzag in a 3-valent plane graph is a circuit of edges, such that
any two, but no three, consecutive edges belong to the same face.

Using the work of the Bielefeld school, we investigated the zigzag
and central-circuit structure of 3- or 4-valent plane graphs, whose
faces have gonality p or q. The case q=6 or 4 is of special interest,
since it corresponds to faces having zero curvature.

I will explain Thurston's formalism for handling those classes of
graphs and how in the case of Goldberg-Coxeter construction, one can
obtain the full description of the zigzag or central-circuit structure.

Then, I will explain, the notion of tightness of graphs and the extremal
problems related to it.
