bases of toric varieties and the Rees algebras of monomial ideals in
discrete optimisation. We will place particular emphasis on how each
method provides new results and new ways of thinking about central
problems in discrete optimisation. We will close with an application 
to statistical disclosure limitation. Rather than describing the algebraic
content head on we will instead provide geometric and combinatorial
descriptions of these techniques. No former background in computational

question which arises is that of integrability. By combining numerical and analytical techniques we are 
able to prove that the geodesic equations of a class of surfaces defined in terms of the spherical 
harmonics are not integrable, and that there are chaotic regions of phase space. This talk will combine 
elements of differential geometry, dynamical systems, and group theory, and will not assume any previous knowledge.</span></a></td>

<td class="title"><a class="abstract" href="">Nonlinear elasticity theory: a rich source of interesting mathematical problems<span>Continuum mechanics theories for solids and fluids have played a significant role 
in the development of many areas of applied mathematics. For example, the classical theory of 
linear elasticity, applicable to the mechanical behaviour of metals, has been an important 
motivation for the study of important linear partial differential equations and systems of 
such equations. Here we describe how the nonlinear theory of hyperelastic materials, 
applicable to the mechanical behaviour of rubber and soft biological tissues, plays 
an analogous role. The basic theory of continuum mechanics of such materials is first 
reviewed. Some classical models relating stress and strain in rubber-like materials are 
described as well as more recent models applicable to biomaterials. Some particular 
deformation modes are then described leading to the governing quasilinear partial 
differential equations and systems of such equations. This lecture is of expository 
nature and assumes no prior familiarity with continuum mechanics theories. The main 
objective is to demonstrate that nonlinear elasticity theory, in addition to being 
a fundamental continuum mechanics theory applicable to a wide variety of materials, 
continues to provide a rich source of interesting and challenging mathematical problems.</span></a></td>

<td class="title"><a class="abstract" href="">Random to Random Shuffles and Commuting Families of Matrices<span>We describe a family of matrices with rows and columns indexed by permutations. The entries generalize the inversion statistics on the symmetric group. These matrices are not only related to the inversion statistics but also are scaled versions of the transition matrices of Markov chains generalizing the random to random shuffle and can be factored into projections on a polytope generalizing the linear ordering polytope. We show some of the beautiful properties of these matrices. In particular, we study the algebra generated by the matrices, which can be seen as a subalgebra of the group algebra of the symmetric group. Finally we describe a generalization of the matrices within the symmetric group and for general finite Coxeter groups. (this is joint work with Franco Saliola and Vic Reiner).</span></a></td>

We prove localization for a particular example of the walk with memory. The talk will involve aspects of mathematics, physics and computer science.</span></a></td>

I will present elementary counterexamples to this conjecture and some cases where the conjecture does hold. This is joint work with Igor Klep.</span></a></td>

<td class="title"><a class="abstract" href="">Gauss-Jacobi advances<span>In [1], introducing the notion of a Gauss factorial, we gave the first extension of Gauss's generalisation of Wilson's theorem (Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, 1801); [1] extended, to composite moduli, work which began with Lagrange in 1777 and ended with Mordell in 1961. <br> 

In 1828 Gauss proved his beautiful mod p binomial coefficient congruence, and in 1837 Jacobi proved his closely related mod p congruence. The former concerns primes (5, 13, 17, 29...) that are 1 (mod 4), the latter primes (7, 13, 19, 31 ... ) that are 1 (mod 3). <br>

In a 1983 Paris seminar Frits Beukers conjectured a mod p^{2} extension of Gauss' congruence, which was settled by S. Chowla, B. Dwork and R. Evans (1986). R. Evans and K. M. Yeung independently proved (late 1980's) a mod p^{2}  extension of Jacobi's congruence. <br>

No mod p^{3} extension of either Gauss's or Jacobi's congruences had been conjectured until 2007, when -- as an outcome of our investigations of one very special class of Gauss factorials -- we formulated and proved mod p^{3} extensions of both the Gauss and Jacobi congruences. <br>

In this entirely elementary talk I shall treat all of this. <br><br>

dynamics, such as linearised Navier-Stokes and Oseen equations, in
semiconductor device simulation and flows in chemical reactions. The
understanding of numerical methods applied to these models is important in
order to solve them numerically. 
In this talk we will see a collection of typical examples showing the
unexpected behaviour of numerical methods when applied to singular
perturbation problems.
Not only on standard equidistant meshes, but even on layer-adapted meshes
several surprising phenomena are shown to occur. We will discuss and analyse
them.</span></a></td>

is one of the most powerful and restrictive bounds for the existence of

One viewpoint in establishing the LP-bound comes from MacWilliams'
theorem relating the weight enumerator of a code with its formal dual.

In this talk I will focus on a difference set with 85 elements in a group of order 341. L=21 in this case and this difference set exists, belonging to a classical family. <br>
This group has a subgroup of order 31 and we can show by a few different arguments that there are 15 elements from the normalized difference set in this subgroup. (arguments range from basic counting, to looking at the orbits of the Hall multiplier, to simple applications of more technical combinatoric arguments). Unfortunately, I can not establish that these 15 elements must a priori express each element of this subgroup exactly 7 times i.e. that there is a (31,15,7)-difference set embedded in this larger difference set. This is the problem I will discuss.<br>
In this talk I will give an overview of the known techniques for attacking such a problem, and explain briefly where this particular case might lead and why it is interesting. The talk will be elementary and I will keep it as non-technical as possible. The problem posed is low-hanging fruit.</span></a></td>

Such models have been used to aid understanding of the spread of cultural fads and the diffusion of innovations, and can be generalized to include percolation problems, k-core sizes, and the study of (SIR-type) epidemics on networks. For this class of problems, I present recent results on the analytic determination of the expected size of cascades on networks of arbitrary degree distribution, and outline extensions and applications of this research.</span></a></td>

<td class="title"><a class="abstract" href="">Variations on the Varying Coefficient Model<span>Although the literature on varying coefficient models (VCMs) is vast, we believe that there remains room to make these models more widely accessible and provide a unified and practical implementation for a variety of complex data settings. The adaptive nature and strength of P-spline VCMs allow for a full range of models: from simple to additive structures, from standard to generalized linear models, from one-dimensional coefficient curves to two-dimensional (or higher) coefficient surfaces, among others, including bilinear models and signal regression. As P-spline VCMs are grounded in classical or generalized (penalized) regression, fitting is swift and desirable diagnostics are available. We will see that in higher dimensions, tractability is only ensured if efficient array regression approaches are implemented. We also motivate our approaches through several examples to highlight the breadth and utility of our approach.

Then I mention some results which describe representation spaces of one quadratic algebra, well-known in non-commutative geometry: Jordan algebra. These include classifcation of irreducible components of the space of n-dimensional representations. As a consequence, the number of irreducible components turned out to be equal to the number of partitions of n. If time permits I also explain a surprising connection between representation theory of quadratic algebras with questions on existance of Novicov structures, prominent by their appearance in the study of Poisson brackets of hydrodynamic type in integrable systems and by their connections to the conformal Lie theory.

<td class="title"><a class="abstract" href="">The integral homology of PSL_2 of imaginary quadratic integers with
non-trivial class group<span>We show that a cellular complex described by Floege allows to determine
the integral homology of the Bianchi groups PSL_2(O_{-m}), where
O_{-m} is the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic number field
Q[\sqrt{-m}] for a square-free natural number m. We use this to
compute the integral homology in the cases m = 5, 6, 10, 13 and 15, which
before was known only in the cases of trivial class group m = 1, 2, 3, 7
and 11.</span></a></td>

<td class="title"><a class="abstract" href="">Small filling sets of curves on surfaces<span>This talk is about joint work with Hugo Parlier and Alexandra Pettet.   The
general problem we are considering is the structure of sets of simple closed
curves on a closed surface that fill; that is, sets of curves whose
complement is the union of (topological) discs.  I will give a brief history
of where and why the question arose and discuss our first results, which
involve bounding the minimal number of curves in a set of filling curves.</span></a></td>

<td class="title"><a class="abstract" href="">Lattice Packings and Coverings<span>A family of balls in Euclidean space is called a packing if for
any two balls B and B' their interior do not self-intersect. It is called
a covering if every point belong to at least one ball.<br>

We focus here on packings and coverings for which the calls are of the form
x + B(0,R) with x belonging to a lattice L. If L is fixed then we adjust the
value of R to a value R0 to find the best packing. Alternatively we can
adjust the value of R to a value R1 to find the best covering. This allow
us to define the packing density pack(L) and covering density cov(L) of L.<br>

The geometry of the function pack on the space of lattices has been
elucidated by Minkovski, Voronoi and Ash. They showed that the function
pack has no local minimum, that it is a Morse function and they give
a characterization of the local maximum in terms of the algebraic notions
of perfection and eutaxy.<br>

The covering function cov is much more complex. It has local minimum and
local maximum and it is not a Morse function. We also characterize the
local maximum of the covering density in terms of the corresponding notions
of perfection and eutaxy this time for Delaunay polytope.</span></a></td>

<td class="title"><a class="abstract" href="">Data compression and regression based on local principal curves and surfaces.<span>
In a  multivariate regression problem with p-dimensional predictor space, the intrinsic dimensionality of the latter is often far smaller than p, sometimes even just one or two.  Usual modelling attempts such as the additive model,  which try to reduce the complexity of the regression problem by making additional structural assumptions,  are then inefficient  as they ignore the inherent structure of the predictor space and involve complicated model and variable selection stages. <br><br>

In a fundamentally different approach,  one may consider first approximating the predictor space by a (usually nonlinear) curve, and then regressing the response only against the one-dimensional projections onto this curve. This entails the reduction from a p- to a one- dimensional regression problem.   As a tool for the compression of the predictor space we apply local principal curves.  We show how local principal curves can be parametrized and how the projections are obtained. The actual regression step can then be carried out using any nonparametric smoother.  If the intrinsic dimension of the predictor space is 2 (or more), one needs to replace the local principal curve by an adequate structure of higher dimension.  We demonstrate how the idea of local principal curves can be extended towards local principal surfaces (or manifolds) through relatively simple means. The proposed techniques are illustrated using astronomical and oceanographic data examples.</span></a></td>
